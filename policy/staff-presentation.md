# Staff presentation

Presentation to Culpeper County Planning Commission by planning staff. Covers rationale for amending zoning/subdivision and provides potential options for making changes.

## Existing conditions

88.2% of the County is zoned A1 or RA
- 66% is A1
- 22.2% is RA

Code allows for 3 acre (RA) and 5 acre (A-1) lots along state-maintained roads with suitable amount of frontage and 10 acre lots on 50ft access easements/private roads.

Parcels in the A1 and RA are only eligible for minor divisions (2 new lots plus 1 residual/parent tract per 5 years) and family divisions (after 5 years of ownership and only to direct family members)

Additionally, there are no road design standards for minor & family divisions beyond having an easement 50ft in width.

## Why Change

Support adopted 2023 Comprehensive Plan land use goals.

Support existing Zoning Ordinance “Purpose and Intent” for the A-1 and RA districts.

The time-based methodology currently used for minor divisions isn’t expressly granted by State Code and may have legal risk.

Existing minimum lot sizes aren’t ideal for encouraging agricultural uses or to allow for residences to coexist with agricultural uses well.

The expansive areas of development at existing densities can lead to a strain on infrastructure such as existing secondary roads, schools, EMS, groundwater, etc.

## A Note On Downzoning

It is possible for a locality to do a Comprehensive Downzoning when:

1. It affects all or a substantial part of the land within the community
2. It is the product of a long study and careful consideration
3. It is initiated by the locality’s governing body or planning commission
4. It regulates all uses within the zoned area

A similar measure was done in Stafford County, which raised the acreage requirements from 3 acres to 6 acres in their A-1 district.

## Option 1: No Change

No changes to any aspect of the code
- Same densities
- Same lot minimums & sizes
- No provisions for clustering

- Still have legally challengeable time-based restrictions

- Could still do a separate change to the County’s private road requirements or other subdivision criteria.

## Option 2: Increase Minimum Lot Sizes (Reduced Density)

- Raise the lot minimums for both districts, such as 6 acres for the RA and 10 or 20 acres for the A1.
- Require Road frontage requirements of 250ft. for RA to achieve 6-acre lot.
- Increases minimum lot size to where agricultural uses could be more easily enjoyed and benefit
from local land use tax incentives. Such as 6+ acre minimum for some agricultural uses and 20+ acres for forestry uses.

## Option 3: Decrease allowed Density, Paired With Clustering

- Decrease the development rights allowed but allow for clustering.
- For example, raise the A1 minimum to 20 acres but allow most of the permitted dwelling units to be on smaller lots to preserve a large lot.
- The minimum lot size for clustered lots could be as low as 1 or 2 acres.
- Could have a maximum lot size for clustered lots as well.
- Could steer clusters on or off state-maintained roads.

## Option 4: Decrease allowed Density with Incentivized Clustering option (to gain density back)

- Decrease the development rights allowed, allow for clustering, and allow for additional density if clustered.
- For example, raise the A1 minimum to 20 acres, but allow for the old density of 5 acres per dwelling if all but one of the proposed lots are clustered.
- This preserves a large lot while still maintaining existing density.
- The minimum lot size for clustered lots could be as low as 1 or 2 acres.
- Could have a maximum lot size for clustered lots as well.
- Could steer clusters on or off state- maintained roads.

## Option 5: Require clustering in A1/RA but allow option that uses current time-based regulations

Create a new primary minor subdivision ordinance that requires clustering, with an alternative option that uses the current time-based system and lot minimums.

- Minimum 70% of land must be deed-restricted to one parcel with current rights of a parcel in A1/RA excepting subdivision rights
- Minimum 70% of any state road frontage must convey with the 70% land if practicable (if it can be achieved without reducing the permitted density in the 30% cluster)

30% if the land is developable with the following conditions:

- The number of building rights would be the total density currently allowed less one right for the 70% open space tract.
- Minimum road standards would be required, and they would align with the type of VDOT entrance (PE, low-volume commercial (LVC), commercial). Commercial entrances would require 16’ wide roads, with minimum bases, acceptable drainage, etc. LVC entrances would require adequate ditching, drainage, etc. PE would have no standards.
- Road standards would have to be met before building permits could be issued.
- Minimum lot size is 2 acres.
- Will need to possibly consider a soils overlay district. As some parcels in the “shrink-swell” soil areas could realize an increased density with this methodology.
