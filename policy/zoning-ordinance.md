## 2-2. Measurements.

This Division explains how measurements are made in the Zoning Ordinance.

-   A.Fractions. When calculations result in fractions the results will be rounded as follows: 1.Minimum Requirements. When a regulation is expressed in terms of a minimum requirement, any fractional result shall be rounded up to the next consecutive whole number. For example, if a minimum requirement of one (1) parking space for every two hundred (200) square feet is applied to a eight thousand fifty-square foot building, the resulting fraction of 40.25 is rounded up to forty-one (41) required spaces. If a minimum requirement of one (1) tree for every thirty (30) feet is applied to a fifty-foot strip, the resulting fraction of 1.67 is rounded up to two (2) required trees.

2.Maximum Limits.
When a regulation is expressed in terms of maximum limits, any fractional result shall be rounded down to the next lower whole number.
For example, if a maximum limit of one (1) dwelling unit for every three thousand (3,000) square feet is applied to an eight thousand-square foot lot, the resulting fraction of 2.67 is rounded down to two (2) allowed dwelling units.

-   B.Measuring Distances. 1.Distances are Measured Horizontally. When determining distances for setbacks and structure dimensions, all distances are measured along a horizontal plane from the appropriate property line, edge of building, structure, storage area, parking area, or other object. These distances are not measured by following the topography of the land.

2.Measurements are Shortest Distances.
When measuring a required distance, such as the minimum distance between a structure and a lot line, the measurement is made at the shortest distance between the two (2) objects.

3.Measurements Involving a Structure.
Measurements involving a structure are made to the closest wall of the structure.
Items such as enclosed porches and entrances, are included in the measurement.

4.Measuring Distances on Maps.
Zoning district boundaries that are shown crossing lots are usually based on a topographic feature or a set measurement from a lot line or topographic feature, such as middle of a stream, twenty-five (25) feet from top of bank, or thirty (30) feet from property line.
When zone district boundaries are shown crossing lots with no clear indication of the basis for the line, exact distances are to be determined by scaling the distances from the Official Zoning Maps, using the center of the district line.

-   C.Measuring Height. 1.Measuring Height of Structures (Non-buildings). The height of non-building structures, such as flag poles, commercial wireless telecommunication towers and fences, is the vertical distance from the finished ground level immediately under the structure to the top of a structure, excluding any exempt portions. When chimneys and other objects are allowed to exceed the base height of the zone district by a set amount, that set amount is measured to the top of these objects. Special measurement provisions are also provided below.

2.Measuring the Height of Retaining Walls and Fences.
Retaining walls and fences are measured from the higher finished ground level side of the retaining wall or fence.

3.Measuring Height of Decks.
Deck height is determined by measuring from the finished ground level to the top of the floor of the deck if there is no rail or if the rail walls are more than fifty percent (50%) open, and from the ground to the top of the rails for all other situations.

# ARTICLE 7.1B. INDUSTRIAL DISTRICT HI

## 7.1B-1. Statement of intent.

The primary purpose of this district is to establish an area where the principal use of land is for heavy commercial and industrial operations, which may create some nuisance, and which are not properly associated with, nor compatible with, residential, institutional and neighborhood commercial service establishments.
The specific intent of this district is to:

7.1B-1-1 Encourage the construction of and the continued use of the land for heavy commercial and industrial purposes.

7.1B-1-2 Prohibit residential and neighborhood commercial use of the land and to prohibit other uses which would substantially interfere with the development, continuation or expansion of commercial and industrial uses in the district or compromise the investment in industrial activity.

## 7.1B-2. Use regulations.

The following regulations shall apply in all HI Districts:

7.1B-2-1 Prohibited uses:

7.1B-2-1.1 All residential structures and uses, excluding a night watchman, caretaker or resident security facility limited to five percent (5%) of the structure.

( Ord. of 2-2-2021 )

## 8A-4. Description of Special Flood Hazard Districts/Establishment of Zoning Districts.

8A-4-1 Basis of Districts

The various special flood hazard districts shall include the SFHAs.
The basis for the delineation of these districts shall be the FIS and the FIRM for Culpeper County, Virginia and Unincorporated Areas prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, dated February 26, 2021 and any subsequent or amendments thereto.

The County may identify and regulate local flood hazard or ponding areas that are not delineated on the FIRM.
These areas may be delineated on a "Local Flood Hazard Map" using best available topographic data and locally derived information such as flood of record, historic high water marks or approximate study methodologies.

The boundaries of the SFHA Districts are established as shown on the FIRM which is declared to be a part of this ordinance and which shall be kept on file at the county's Department of Development offices.

8A-4-1.1 The Floodway District is in an AE zone and is delineated, for purposes of this ordinance, using the criterion that certain areas within the floodplain must be capable of carrying the waters on the one percent annual chance flood without increasing the water surface elevation of that flood more than one (1) foot at any point.
The areas included in this District are specifically defined in the above referenced FIS and shown on the accompanying FIRM.

The following provisions shall apply within the Floodway District of an AE zone [44 CFR 60.3(d)]:

A.Within any floodway area, no encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements, or other development shall be permitted unless it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not result in any increase of the water surface elevation of the base flood at any point within the County.
Hydrologic and hydraulic analyses shall be undertaken only by professional engineers or others of demonstrated qualifications, who shall certify that the technical methods used correctly reflect currently-accepted technical concepts.
Studies, analyses, computations, etc., shall be submitted in sufficient detail to allow a thorough review by the Floodplain Administrator.

B.The placement of manufactured homes (mobile homes) is prohibited, except in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision.
A replacement manufactured home may be placed on a lot in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision provided the anchoring, elevation, and encroachment standards are met.

8A-4-1.2 The AE, or AH Zones on the FIRM accompanying the FIS shall be those areas for which one-percent annual chance flood elevations have been provided and the floodway has not been delineated.
The following provisions shall apply within an AE or AH zone [44CFR 60.3(c)] where FEMA has provided base flood elevations.

Until a regulatory floodway is designated, no new construction, substantial improvements, or other development (including fill) shall be permitted within the areas of special flood hazard, designated as Zones A1-30, AE, AH on the FIRM, unless it is demonstrated that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point within the County.

Development activities in Zones A1-30, AE, or AH on the county's FIRM which increase the water surface elevation of the base flood by more than one foot may be allowed, provided that the applicant first applies, with the county's endorsement, for a Conditional Letter of Map Revision, and receives the approval of FEMA.

8A-4-1.3 The A Zone on the FIRM accompanying the FIS shall be those areas for which no detailed flood profiles or elevations are provided, but the one percent annual chance floodplain boundary has been approximated.
For these areas, the following provisions shall apply [44 CFR 60.3(b)]:

The Approximated Floodplain Overlay District shall be that floodplain area for which no detailed flood profiles or elevations are provided, but where a one percent annual chance floodplain boundary has been approximated.
Such areas are shown as Zone A on the maps accompanying the FIS.
For these areas, the base flood elevations and floodway information from federal, state, and other acceptable sources shall be used, when available.
Where the specific one percent annual chance flood elevation cannot be determined for this area using other sources of data, such as the U.S.
Army Corps of Engineers Floodplain Information Reports, U.S. Geological Survey Flood-Prone Quadrangles, etc. then the applicant for the proposed use, development, or activity shall determine the base flood elevation.
For development proposed in the approximate floodplain the applicant must use technical methods that correctly reflect currently accepted practices, such as point on boundary, high water marks, or detailed methodologies, hydrologic and hydraulic analyses.
Studies, analyses, computations, etc., shall be submitted in sufficient detail to allow a thorough review by the Floodplain Administrator.

The Floodplain Administrator reserves the right to require a hydrologic and hydraulic analysis for any development.
When such base flood elevation data is utilized, the lowest floor shall be elevated to or above the base flood level plus eighteen (18) inches.

During the permitting process, the Floodplain Administrator shall obtain:

A.The elevation of the lowest floor (in relation to mean sea level), including the basement, of all new and substantially improved structures; and,

B.If the structure has been flood-proofed in accordance with the requirements of this article, the elevation (in relation to mean sea level) to which the structure has been flood-proofed.

Base flood elevation data shall be obtained from other sources or developed using detailed methodologies comparable to those contained in a FIS for subdivision proposals and other development proposals (including manufactured homes and subdivisions) that exceed fifty lots or five acres, whichever is the lesser.

8A-4-2 Overlay Concept

The Floodplain Overlay District described above shall be overlays to the existing underlying zoning district areas as shown on the Official Zoning Ordinance Map, and as such, the provisions for the Floodplain Overlay District shall serve as a supplement to the underlying zoning district provisions.

Any conflict between the provisions or requirements of the Floodplain Overlay District and those of any underlying zoning district, the more restrictive provisions and/or those pertaining to the Floodplain Overlay District shall apply.

In the event any provision concerning a Floodplain Overlay District is declared inapplicable as a result of any legislative or administrative actions or judicial decision, the basic underlying zoning district provisions shall remain applicable.

8A-4-3 Official Zoning Map

The boundaries of the Floodplain Overlay District are established as shown on the Flood Insurance Rate Map which is declared to be a part of this ordinance and which shall be kept on file at the Culpeper County offices.

8A-4-4 District Boundary Changes

The delineation of any of the Floodplain Overlay District may be revised by the Culpeper County Board of Supervisors where natural or man-made changes have occurred and/or where more detailed studies have been conducted or undertaken by the U.S.
Army Corps of Engineers or other qualified agency, or an individual documents the need for such change.
However, prior to any such change, approval must be obtained from the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
A completed LOMR is a record of this approval.

8A-4-5 Interpretation of District Boundaries

The Floodplain Administrator shall make initial interpretations, where needed, as to the exact location of special flood hazard areas, floodplain boundaries, and floodway boundaries.
Should a dispute arise concerning the boundaries of the Districts, the Board of Zoning Appeals shall make the necessary determination.
The following shall apply to the use and interpretation of FIRMs and data:

8A-4-5.1 Where field surveyed topography indicates that adjacent ground elevations:

A.Area below the base flood elevation, even in areas not delineated as a special flood hazard area on a FIRM, the area shall be considered as special flood hazard area and subject to the requirements of these regulations.

B.Area above the base flood elevation, the area shall be regulated as a special flood hazard area unless the applicant obtains a Letter of Map Change that removes the area from the SFHA.

8A-4-5.2 In FEMA identified special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation and floodway data have not been identified and in areas where FEMA has not identified SFHAs, any other flood hazard data available from a Federal, State, or other source shall be reviewed and reasonably used.

8A-4-5.3 Base flood elevations and designated floodway boundaries on FIRMs and in FISs shall take precedence over base flood elevations and floodway boundaries by any other sources if such sources show reduced floodway widths and/or lower base flood elevations.

8A-4-5.4 Other sources of data shall be reasonably used if such sources show increased base flood elevations and/or larger floodway areas than are shown on FIRMs and in FISs.

8A-4-5.5 If a Preliminary Flood Insurance Rate Map and/or a Preliminary Flood Insurance Study has been provided by FEMA:

A.Upon the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by FEMA, the preliminary flood hazard data shall be used and shall replace the flood hazard data previously provided from FEMA for the purpose of administering these regulations.

B.Prior to the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by FEMA, the use of preliminary flood hazard data shall be deemed the best available and used where no base flood elevations and/or floodway areas are provided on the effective FIRM.

C.Prior to issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by FEMA, the use of preliminary flood hazard data is permitted where the preliminary base flood elevations or floodway areas exceed the base flood elevations and/or designated floodway widths in existing flood hazard data provided by FEMA.
Such preliminary data may be subject to change and/or appeal to FEMA.

8A-4-6 Jurisdictional Boundary Changes

The County floodplain ordinance in effect on the date of annexation shall remain in effect and shall be enforced by the municipality for all annexed areas until the municipality adopts and enforces an ordinance which meets the requirements for participation in the National Flood Insurance Program.
Municipalities with existing floodplain ordinances shall pass a resolution acknowledging and accepting responsibility for enforcing floodplain ordinance standards prior to annexation of any area containing identified flood hazards.
If the FIRM for any annexed area includes special flood hazard areas that have flood zones that have regulatory requirements that are not set forth in these regulations, the governing body shall prepare amendments to these regulations to adopt the FIRM and appropriate requirements, and submit the amendments to the governing body for adoption; such adoption shall take place at the same time as or prior to the date of annexation and a copy of the amended regulations shall be provided to Department of Conservation and Recreation (Division of Dam Safety and Floodplain Management) and FEMA.

In accordance with the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 44 Subpart (B) Section 59.22 (a) (9) (v) all NFIP participating communities must notify the Federal Insurance Administration and optionally the State Coordinating Office in writing whenever the boundaries of the County have been modified by annexation or the County has otherwise assumed or no longer has authority to adopt and enforce floodplain management regulations for a particular area.

In order that all Flood Insurance Rate Maps accurately represent the County's boundaries, a copy of a map of the County suitable for reproduction, clearly delineating the new corporate limits or new area for which the County has assumed or relinquished floodplain management regulatory authority must be included with the notification.

8A-4-7 Submitting Model Backed Technical Data

The County's base flood elevations may increase or decrease resulting from physical changes affecting flooding conditions.
As soon as practicable, but not later than six months after the date such information becomes available, the County shall notify FEMA of the changes by submitting technical or scientific data.
The County may submit data via a LOMR.
Such a submission is necessary so that upon confirmation of those physical changes affecting flooding conditions, risk premium rates and floodplain management requirements will be based on current data.

8A-4-8 Letters of Map Revision

When development in the floodplain will cause or causes a change in the base flood elevation, the applicant, including state agencies, must notify FEMA by applying for a Conditional Letter of Map Revision and then a Letter of Map Revision.

Examples may include but are not limited to:

A.Any development that causes a rise in the base flood elevations within the floodway.

B.Any development occurring in Zones A1-30 and AE without a designated floodway, which will cause a rise of more than one foot in the base flood elevation.

C.Alteration or relocation of a stream (including but not limited to installing culverts and bridges).

## 8A-6. Existing Structures in Floodplain Areas.

Any structure or use of a structure or premises must be brought into conformity with these provisions when it is changed, repaired, or improved unless one of the following exceptions is established before the change is made:

8A-6-1 The Floodplain Administrator has determined that:

A.Change is not a substantial repair or substantial improvement; and

B.No new square footage is being built in the floodplain that is not compliant; and

C.No new square footage is being built in the floodway; and

D.The change complies with this ordinance and the Virginia Uniform Statewide Building Code; and

8A-6-2 The changes are required to comply with a citation for a health or safety violation.

8A-6-3 The structure is a historic structure and the change required would impair the historic nature of the structure.
Any exemption from ordinance requirements will be the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure.

( Ord. of 2-2-2021 )

## 8A-7. Variances.

8A-7-1 Factors to be Considered

Variances shall be issued only upon (i) a showing of good and sufficient cause, (ii) after the Board of Zoning Appeals has determined that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant, and (iii) after the Board of Zoning Appeals has determined that the granting of such variance will not result in (a) unacceptable or prohibited increases in flood heights, (b) additional threats to public safety, (c) extraordinary public expense; and will not (d) create nuisances, (e) cause fraud or victimization of the public, or (f) conflict with local laws or ordinances.

While the granting of variances generally is limited to a lot size less than one acre, deviations from that limitation may occur.
However, as the lot size increases beyond one acre, the technical justification required for issuing a variance increased, Variances may be issued by the Board of Zoning Appeals for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, in conformance with the provisions of this Section.

Variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements and for other development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that the criteria of this Section are met, and the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety.

In passing upon applications for Variances, the Board of Zoning Appeals shall satisfy all relevant factors and procedures specified in other sections of the zoning ordinance and consider the following additional factors:

8A-7-1.1 The danger to life and property due to increased flood heights or velocities caused by encroachments.
No variance shall be granted for any proposed use, development, or activity within any floodway that will cause any increase in the one percent (1%) chance flood elevation.

8A-7-1.2 The danger that materials may be swept on to other lands or downstream to the injury of others.

8A-7-1.3 The proposed water supply and sanitation systems and the ability of these systems to prevent disease, contamination, and unsanitary conditions.

8A-7-1.4 The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owners.

8A-7-1.5 The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the locality.

8A-7-1.6 The requirements of the facility for a waterfront location.

8A-7-1.7 The availability of alternative locations not subject to flooding for the proposed use.

8A-7-1.8 The compatibility of the proposed use with existing development and development anticipated in the foreseeable future.

8A-7-1.9 The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for the area.

8A-7-1.10 The safety of access by ordinary and emergency vehicles to the property in time of flood.

8A-7-1.11 The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment transport of the floodwaters expected at the site.

8A-7-1.12 The historic nature of a structure.
Variances for repair or rehabilitation of historic structures may be granted upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure.

8A-7-1.13 Such other factors which are relevant to the purposes of this ordinance.

8A-7-2 Referral

The Board of Zoning Appeals may refer any application and accompanying documentation pertaining to any request for a variance to any engineer or other qualified person or agency for technical assistance in evaluating the proposed project in relation to flood heights and velocities, and the adequacy of the plans for flood protection and other related matters.

8A-7-3 Determinations

Variances shall be issued only after the Board of Zoning Appeals has determined that the granting of such will not result in (a) unacceptable or prohibited increases in flood heights, (b) additional threats to public safety, (c) extraordinary public expense; and will not (d) create nuisances, (e) cause fraud or victimization of the public, or (f) conflict with local laws or ordinances.

Variances shall be issued only after the Board of Zoning Appeals has determined that variance will be the minimum required to provide relief from any exceptional hardship to the applicant.

8A-7-4 Notification

The Board of Zoning Appeals shall notify the applicant for a variance, in writing, that the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the one percent (1%) chance flood elevation (a) increases the risks to life and property and (b) will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance.

8A-7-5 Records to be Kept

A record shall be maintained of the above notification as well as all variance action, including justification for the issuance of the variances.
Any variances which are issued shall be noted in the annual or biennial report submitted to the Federal Insurance Administrator.

( Ord. of 2-2-2021 )

## 8A-8. Enforcement, Violations, Noncompliance, and Penalties.

8A-8-1 Abrogation and Greater Restrictions:

When in conflict, the provisions of this Article 8A generally supersede any ordinance in effect under other chapters of the County Code of Ordinances, including those in effect under other articles of the Zoning Ordinance (Appendix A) or the Building Regulations (Chapter 6) in the Culpeper County Code currently in effect in flood-prone districts, except as provided herein this section.
Any ordinance in effect under other articles of the Zoning Ordinance (Appendix A) in the Culpeper County Code shall remain in full force and effect, but in the event of conflict with the provisions of this Article 8A, the more restrictive provision shall prevail.
These regulations are not intended to repeal or abrogate any existing ordinances including subdivision regulations, zoning ordinances, or building codes and regulations.
In the event of a conflict between the provisions of this Article 8A and any other Culpeper County ordinance, the more restrictive shall govern.

8A-8-2 Severability:

If any section, subsection, paragraph, sentence, clause, or phrase of this Ordinance and Article 8A shall be declared invalid for any reason whatever, such decision shall not affect the remaining portions of this Ordinance and Article 8A. The remaining portions shall remain in full force and effect; and for this purpose, the provisions of this Ordinance and Article 8A are hereby declared to be severable.

8A-8-3 Violations:

Any person who fails to comply with any of the requirements or provisions of this Ordinance and Article 8A shall be in violation of the Culpeper County Code of Ordinances, and specifically the Zoning Ordinance (Appendix A) and guilty of a zoning violation, and subject to the appropriate civil or criminal action and penalties as are provided for in the County Code of Ordinances, in the Zoning Ordinance (Appendix A), herein this Article 8A and including but not limited to Article 23, and/or under the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia.
Enforcement actions may be instituted by the County and/or by the Floodplain Administrator consistent with the provisions of this Ordinance and Article 8A.

In addition to the above penalties, the authority to institute all other civil actions as are permitted under state and federal law are hereby reserved, including an action in equity and/or seeking injunctive relief for meaningful and proper enforcement of this Article 8A, which is a part of the Zoning Ordinance (Appendix A).
The imposition of a fine or penalty for any violation of, or noncompliance with, this Article 8A does not excuse the violation, or noncompliance - or permit any noncompliance to continue; and all such persons shall be required to correct or remedy such violation within a reasonable time.
Any structure constructed, reconstructed, enlarged, altered, or relocated in noncompliance with or violation of this Article 8A may be declared by the Floodplain Administrator to be a public nuisance and abatable as such.
Flood insurance may be withheld by federal and/or state authorities, as permitted under state and federal law, from structures constructed and used in violation of this Article 8A.

(Editor's Note: The Uniform Statewide Building Code, as incorporated into the Code of Virginia and adopted within the Culpeper County Code of Ordinances, addresses building code violations and the associated penalties in Section 104 and Section 115. Violations and associated penalties of the Zoning Ordinance are generally addressed in Article 23 of the Zoning Ordinance.)

# ARTICLE 8B. PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT (PUD)

## 8B-1. Statement of intent.

8B-1-1 Intent:

This district is intended to accommodate the development of large tracts of land and provide incentive for design flexibility and the creation of a more desirable, coordinated living environment than would be possible under the strict application of traditional zoning.
The regulations of this district are intended to recognize that changing community and land use trends have created a need for a consolidated zoning district which promotes an integrated planned community within which commercial, office, light industrial, research and development, residential, recreation and a variety of uses are conveniently linked.

8B-1-2 Objectives:

The objectives of the PUD District are generally:

8B-1-2.1 To promote the Comprehensive Plan of the community through compatible commercial, office, light industrial, residential and recreational components, each known as an activity area, within the same coordinated zoning district, in support of the "village centers" as contained in the Comprehensive Plan.

8B-1-2.2 To achieve the goals set forth in the Comprehensive Plan, including economic enhancement, provision of adequate services and public facilities and the orderly development of the County commensurate with the area proposed and the reasonable phasing of County infrastructure as identified in the Comprehensive Plan and/or scheduled in the Capital Improvement Program.

8B-1-2.3 To encourage and achieve a variety of high-quality residential development areas and provide housing to meet the varied needs of the County's population in locations and quantities that are in concert with the recommendations of the Comprehensive Plan.

8B-1-2.4 To promote architectural and design excellence through application of advanced community design concepts, which allows an orderly transition of land from rural to urban development.

8B-1-2.5 To reduce commuter demand on highways and roads by linking residential housing and recreational amenities with the workplace and other community functions.

8B-1-2.6 To provide a variety of housing types, employment opportunities, commercial, research and development, light industrial and recreation services to provide a balanced community that contributes to a cohesive living style in an integrated development environment.

8B-1-2.7 To provide for standards and development guidelines which will produce a harmonious atmosphere for the development of certain commercial, research and development and light industrial uses compatible with complementary residential, recreational and open space uses.

8B-1-2.8 To provide flexibility to develop the site in a manner which promotes the economic and efficient development of land use; provides improved public amenities; encourages appropriate and harmonious development; encourages creative design which is sensitive to the environment and which preserves and enhances specific historic sites and buildings; and promotes the conservation of unique natural features of the site as it relates to slope, size, shape, geology and other aspects of the land.

8B-1-2.9 To provide appropriate guidelines to provide for a mixture of uses which conserves existing environmental resources and features, provide usable passive and active open space and provide for the more effective development of utilities and public improvements.
(Ord. of 12-3-1991, § 8B-1)

## 8B-2. Application and procedures.

The WMD shall provide for protection of the watershed and its headwaters through minimum disturbance of the land, restriction of stormwater pollution and avoidance of water quality degradation.
In addition, the groundwater capabilities of the watershed shall be protected to provide for aquifer recharge as the sole alternate to surface water drinking supplies.

8C-1-2 Findings of fact:

8C-1-2.1 It is the aim of this district to provide regulations that will apply within the designated watershed, as adopted by the County Comprehensive Plan and in accordance with the Lake Pelham-Mountain Run Lake Watershed Management Plan and its implementation policies, to respond to the unique conditions and special circumstances presented there and prevent the further or future deterioration of associated water resources.
This watershed has been identified as a sensitive resource that requires exceptional means and careful planning to avoid compromising the stormwater and lake reservoir system and its public benefits.

8C-1-2.2 The public interest is best served by protecting the capabilities of the watershed for current and future residents and preventing the deterioration of water quality.
As a limited resource, the lake system is subject to accelerated degradation from development and human activity that could create a public health liability, severely restrict the usefulness of the resource and/or produce significant public cost to restore, if possible.

8C-1-2.3 Therefore, these regulations are promulgated to protect these interests, avoid adverse effects and ensure the continued viability of watershed resources.
(Ord. of 3-3-1992, § 8C-1)

## 8C-2. Definitions.

(Ord. of 3-3-1992, § 8C-2)

## 8C-3. Watershed management regulations.

Every development in the watershed shall be subject to the additional regulations contained in this Article.
An evaluation of proposals will be required for evaluating the resulting downstream impact to avoid and/or mitigate those impacts so as to protect the water quality and restrict future degradation of the watershed.
It is incumbent on the applicant to demonstrate that the public interest will be upheld and that protection of the public drinking supply will be preserved.
Development shall be regulated to protect watershed resources to every extent practicable.

8C-3-1 Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA):

Every development in the watershed shall be accompanied by an EIA that assesses the off-site impacts of stormwater generated from the proposal; before-and after-development water quality loadings; the affect of slopes, soils, wetlands, and other natural features; prospective BMP's and effect on stream/lake loadings; and consideration of alternatives to the proposal.
The County may require implementation of a comparable alternative development layout if it is found to be superior in providing water quality protection.
The EIA shall present mitigation measures for identified impacts and, where acceptable to the County, include them in the development plan as a condition of approval.

8C-3-2 Watershed management plan and policies established:

8C-3-2.1 The Watershed Management Plan (Espey, Huston and Associates, Inc.; September 1989) and Policies (adopted into the Comprehensive Plan; January 1990) are hereby incorporated as a part of this Article to identify critical elements of the watershed, establish analytical criteria and assure the protection of water quality.
The Plan identifies:

a.Watershed boundary.

b.Critical lakes, streams and tributaries.

c.Drainage basins.

d.Buffer areas for critical watercourses.

e.Proposed wet pond sites for consolidated stormwater management.

f.Restrictions on overall development by drainage basin.

g.Identification of critical sewer/water service areas around Lake Pelham.

8C-3-2.2 The Plan and Policies shall be used to review development proposals and establish limits of loadings within each drainage basin in the watershed.

8C-3-3 Cluster development preferred:

8C-3-3.1 The use of cluster development for residential uses is preferred, with required open space to be used for buffering critical watercourses and avoiding environmentally sensitive areas that can compromise downstream resources.
Sensitive environmental areas include steep slopes, lake and stream banks and highly erodible soils.

8C-3-3.2 Any cluster development shall decrease in intensity of use as the distance from the identified stream/water body buffer decreases.
This decreasing density shall be established by creating imaginary five hundred (500) foot bands around the buffer and then establishing the density of each band, diminishing in intensity as the buffer is approached.
If it can be shown that proposed BMP's or natural features of the land, such as topography, will better serve to protect water quality, this requirement may be waived.
Where development is part of a PUD, nonresidential uses shall be limited to commercial activity that is supported by the development and no more than ten percent (10%) of the tract.

8C-3-4 Development limitations:

The WMD establishes overall limits to development within each drainage basin, in accordance with the Watershed Management Plan, to avoid overloading the capacity of each basin and prevent eventual stream/lake degradation.
Each basin contains density limits which represent a maximum for any one (1) development [i.e.: ten (10) dwelling units per acre].
Nonresidential development other than parks, churches, and community facilities shall be limited.
New areas for nonresidential use are not prohibited but are discouraged.
All nonresidential development is subject to density limitations which coincide with the residential limitations.
[For the purpose of exchange, two thousand (2,000) square feet of non-residential floor area is equivalent to a dwelling unit].

8C-3-5 Buffers required:

8C-3-5.1 Development in the WMD shall require buffering around lakes, on each side of streams and along tributaries.
All buffers shall be left in their natural vegetative state or improved with suitable landscaping so as to increase the stormwater and pollutant/nutrient reduction capabilities of the buffer.
General maintenance of such buffers, including removal of undesirable species, is permitted as long as the integrity of the buffer is maintained.
In accordance with the Watershed Management Plan, required watercourse buffers shall be defined as a minimum distance from the watercourse as follows:

a.Lake Pelham and Mountain Run Lake: Two hundred (200) foot minimum from normal pool elevation [384.9 feet elevation, Lake Pelham; 434.0 feet elevation, Mountain Run Lake].

b.Primary streams and wet ponds: One hundred (100) foot minimum from the flood way or the normal pond pool.

c.Identified tributaries: Fifty (50) foot minimum from the center line of the watercourse.

8C-3-5.2 No future development, construction or introduction of impervious surface shall be allowed in the buffer, other than road crossings, passive recreation and utilities, subject to demonstration that no reduction in the quality of the buffer shall occur.
Uses specifically prohibited in the buffer include septic systems and drainfields, feed lots (i.e., finishing cattle for slaughter), fuel or petroleum storage, sewer pump stations, etc.
Detention ponds and dams may be located in the buffer.
Additional buffer will be required around a pond.
(Ord. of 3-3-1992, § 8C-3)

8C-3-6 Lake Pelham-Mountain Run Lake Watershed Restrictions: The Lake Pelham-Mountain Run Lake Watershed serves the Lake Pelham reservoir which is a public water supply for Town and County residents and provides the surface water recharge for the lake.
The watershed has been shown to be sensitive to certain development activities and susceptible to impacts from particular uses that may affect water quality.
The lakes are subject to degradation from hazardous substances that may gain entry by spill, surface runoff or groundwater leachate.
As a result, the following uses and storage thereof are prohibited in the watershed as part of any non-residential activity:

8C-3-6.1 Hazardous materials and wastes.

8C-3-6.2 Flammable or combustible substances and the storage of more than one hundred (100) gallons or fifty (50) pounds of such substances.

8C-3-6.3 Toxic wastes and substances.

8C-3-6.4 Bulk and underground storage.

8C-3-6.5 Landfills and debris sites.

8C-3-6.6 Storage or land spreading of sludge.

In addition, sewer treatment plants and other uses for which a NPDES or VPDES permit is required for more than one thousand (1,000) gallons of effluent are also prohibited, excluding stormwater management facilities.

(Ord. of 5-7-2013(2))

## 8C-4. WMD development standards.

8C-4-1 BMP's required:

8C-4-1.1 Every development shall require some form of best management practices (BMP's) to mitigate watershed impacts and limit on-site effects.
Each development is required to select and implement the most appropriate BMP for dealing with stormwater runoff and protection of water quality.
BMP's may include, but are not limited to, wet or dry ponds, filter strips along roads and drives, limits to site grading, early vegetative cover, spoil pile stabilization, grass swales for drainage channels, hydroseeding of graded areas and other techniques as suggested by the Commonwealth of Virginia State Water Control Board Urban Best Management Practices Handbook, most current edition.

8C-4-1.2 Best management practices shall be reserved solely for the identified purpose for as long as the County requires and adequate provision made for maintenance.
Easements may be required for any BMP included in a development proposal and the area in wet or dry ponds must be dedicated to such use and recorded prior to finalization of any subdivision or site plan.
Adequate assurance of maintenance and future transfer to a legal responsible entity must be provided as a condition for approval.
Golf courses shall be required to develop a nutrient management plan that demonstrates that the fertilizers and pesticides will be contained on-site and will not impact the off-site surface water or groundwater resources.

8C-4-2 Disturbed area, impervious surface:

8C-4-2.1 Development in the WMD shall be limited to minimize land disturbance and reduce the potential of downstream degradation.
Each site or parcel of land shall be restricted as to the total area of disturbance and the creation of impervious, nonporous surfaces to inhibit erosion, reduce runoff and impede the off-site impact of development in the watershed.
Generally, the area of total disturbance of the land for roads/drives, utilities, structures, parking and activity space shall not exceed forty percent (40%) of the tract at any one (1) time, excluding wet ponds and BMP's.
Porous pavement, while not considered impervious surface, is considered disturbed area.
Areas of land disturbance shall be so noted on plats and site plans for review and visibly identified in the field for inspection.
Future site development must include any unstabilized areas resulting from previous disturbance and its cumulative effect on proposed disturbed areas.

8C-4-2.2 The maximum allowable impervious surface area for nonresidential development shall be twenty-five percent (25%) of the tract.
Residential subdivisions shall be limited to a maximum of fifteen percent (15%) impervious surface for each lot and twenty-five percent (25%) of the entire tract for subdivision development.
Clustered development shall not be limited by lot as long as the maximum impervious surface for the entire tract does not exceed twenty-five percent (25%).
Nonresidential subdivisions shall be subject to twelve and five-tenths percent (12.5%) maximum impervious surface for interior roads.

8C-4-2.3 Exemptions for Commercially Zoned Properties.

Property zoned commercial prior to March 3, 1992 shall be exempt from meeting the requirements of Section 8C-3-4, Section 8C-4-2.1 and Section 8C-4-2.2 provided the applicant meets the requirements of Section 8C-4-2.3.

The site development plans shall meet the requirements set forth by the Virginia State Department of Conservation and Recreation (DCR) Handbooks for Stormwater Management and Erosion and Sediment Control.

A water quality analysis shall be performed using the performance based calculation criteria outlined in Chapter 5Section 10 of the DCR Stormwater Management Manual.
The baseline (pre-development) phosphorous loading shall be calculated using a rate forty-five hundredths (0.45) pounds per acre per year (lbs/ac/yr) or sixteen (16) percent impervious cover if using the simple method calculation procedure.
Post development phosphorous loading shall be calculated using the simple method calculation equation: L = 2.28*A*[0.05 + (0.009\*I%)] where A equals site area and I% equals impervious percentage.
Post development loadings shall be reduced to baseline loading though conventional and innovative best management practices (BMP's).

Downstream natural channels shall be analyzed for adequacy to convey the developed condition of a two-year peak discharge within the channel banks and at a non-erosive velocity.
In addition, man made channels are to be analyzed for adequacy to convey the ten-year peak discharge within the channel banks and the two-year peak discharge at a non-erosive velocity.
All man made channels shall be stabilized immediately and prior to being made operable.
When a channel is determined to be not adequate, a stormwater detention BMP shall be sized to discharge the two-year and ten-year frequency developed-condition peak discharge at the respective pre-developed rates.
(VADCR 2-2.2)

Land disturbance sequencing shall adhere to the specifications outlined in section 8C-4-2.1 unless the applicant demonstrates to the plan approving authority that land disturbance in excess of forty (40) percent of the tract area at any given time is required to balance the site or construction cannot otherwise be accomplished.
Accordingly, when land disturbance exceeds forty (40) percent of the tract area, the state specified minimum design wet and dry storage volume for sediment traps and basins shall be doubled to allow for increased settling time.
Perimeter erosion and sediment control shall be provided using diversion berms and not silt fence.
All areas must be stabilized immediately upon reaching final grading and the application of sod is highly encouraged.

If the proposed site development activities exceed sixty (60) percent impervious cover or seventy (70) percent site disturbance then Low Impact Development (LID) analysis and plan shall be prepared for review.
The LID plan shall include site design checklist, LID calculation worksheets, and details of LID practices.
The LID plan shall promote groundwater recharge, provide the required pollutant removal, and maintain the pre-development time of concentration, peak runoff rate and runoff volume.

A preliminary layout plan and stormwater management plan shall be submitted and approved by Culpeper County prior to submittal of the site plan.
As-built plans for all permanent BMP's shall be required and the maintenance of such facilities shall be established prior to bond release.

8C-4-3 Erosion and sediment control plans:

Every development is required to file an erosion and sediment control plan in accordance with Chapter 8 of the Culpeper County Code and the Virginia EandS Control Handbook, most current edition.
Development in the WMD that disturbs five thousand (5,000) square feet or more of land area shall comply with this regulation except agricultural activities as exempted by state law.

8C-4-4 Utility services:

Municipal sewer services shall be encouraged in sensitive areas of the watershed around Lake Pelham.
Drainage Basins GR, HR, LP6 and LP7 are included in Phases I and II; LP2, LP3, LP4, LP5, BB, VB and MR1 are all included in Phase III. Development in Phases I and II should be coordinated to coincide with the implementation of municipal services rather than septic systems.
All other utilities and service methods shall be in accordance with Chapter 14, the Sanitary Code of Culpeper County.
Package plants identified in section 14-20 are prohibited.

8C-4-5 Exclusions, credits and bonuses:

8C-4-5.1 Any property which is shown on a site plan or subdivision plat to be engineered so as not to drain into Lake Pelham, directly or indirectly, shall not be considered to be regulated by the WMD, notwithstanding its depiction on the Official Map, as long as the subsequent development is in accordance with such plan or plat.

8C-4-5.2 If, in the opinion of the Board of Supervisors, it is good planning practice to do so, where land lying within the watershed is under common ownership and is adjacent to or part of a tract proposed for development, the use of which is limited to park, open space or passive recreation, such land can be utilized in establishing the density, impervious surface and disturbed area for the development.
Limitation of use must be guaranteed for all intents and purposes by permanent easement.

(Ords. of 3-3-1992, § 8C-4; 7-5-2005(2); 5-7-2013(2))

## 8C-5. Agricultural activities.

8C-5-1 Farm plans:

All agricultural operations in the watershed shall be encouraged to exercise conservation measures and agricultural BMP's.
Such operations are required to file a farm plan with the Soil and Water Conservation District that meets the intents and objectives of this Article, including required buffers and other pertinent practices as guided by the Soil and Water Conservation District.

8C-5-2 Agricultural hardship:

This Article shall not prevent the Planning Commission from providing an exception to agricultural operations that would otherwise be compromised by these regulations.
These cases are recognized as special hardships that, while required to conform to this Article to further the public purpose, shall not be significantly impaired or restricted from the agricultural use of their property.
(Ord. of 3-3-1992, § 8C-5)

## 8C-6. Vesting.

8C-6-1 Existing parcels:

Proposals for subdivision or site plan approval which have proceeded to the level of public hearing (having been approved by the Planning Commission and/or Board of Supervisors) shall be vested with regard to lot size, density and the other regulations of this Article other than the requirements for buffering, impervious surface or erosion and sediment controls.
Any future site plan or subdivision of the property must fully comply with the regulations contained in this Article.
A (Agricultural), R (Residential), or RA (Rural Area) zoned lots that preexist the adoption of this Article are considered vested with regard to lot size only.
Commercial and industrial properties are vested only with regard to allowable uses.
All existing structures are fully vested.
(Ord. of 6-12-1996)

8C-6-2 Site plan exceptions:

8C-6-2.1 In any case or request for a site plan on a parcel existing on March 3, 1992 and on which the zoning has not changed since that date, in which the applicant claims or can produce evidence that the use of his property will be negatively affected as opposed to the use allowed prior to the enactment of this Article, the Planning Commission may, for good cause shown, at its option and at the request of the applicant, reduce the required buffering on any given parcel so affected.
Upon request, the applicant shall present a proposed buffering plan as an alternative to the Code requirements.
The Planning Commission may adopt this plan or impose other requirements related to the protection of the watershed.

8C-6-2.2 In any case or request for a site plan amendment on a developed parcel existing on March 3, 1992 and on which the zoning has not changed since that date, the density limitations contained in section 8C-3-4 may be waived by the Planning Commission if the total impervious surface on the site is not increased, and if the intent of the Watershed Management District is not compromised.
(Ord. of 10-6-1998)

Editor's note(s)—Amendment of 10-6-1998 moved purview regarding site plan exceptions to the Planning Commission, rather than the Board, modified section 8C-6-2.1 so as to clarify the applicable date, and added section 8C-6-2.2.

8C-6-3 Building permit exceptions:

In any future case or request for a building permit for a zoned lot of record existing at the time of the adoption of this Article and which contains less than ten (10) acres, the zoning administrator shall have the authority to deviate from the buffering requirements imposed by this Article, upon presentation by the applicant for the permit or the landowner, as the case may be, that the strict application of the buffering requirements will so adversely impact on the applicant or owner so as to prevent the owner from utilizing the property in a reasonable manner.
Upon request, the applicant shall present a proposed buffering plan as an alternative to the Code requirements.
The zoning administrator may accept this plan or suggest other requirements related to the protection of the watershed.
Any decision by the zoning administrator made pursuant to this section may be appealed to the Board of Supervisors, to be treated as it would treat a request made pursuant to Subsection 8C-6-2, above.
(Ord. of 3-3-1992, § 8C-6)

|  | 11-25 acres | 250 feet | 200 feet |
|  | 26-50 acres | 300 feet | 250 feet |
|  | 50+ acres | 350 feet | 250 feet |

8E-7-4 Other Protection Measures:

As an alternative to buffers, or as an additional requirement, the following may be imposed as a means of serving the purposes of this Article.

8E-7-4.1 Fences;

8E-7-4.2 Berms;

8E-7-4.3 Landscaping;

8E-7-4.4 Covenants and Easements;

8E-7-4.5 Denial of Application.

8E-7-5 Where buffers may be imposed:

Buffers and protection measures may be imposed only on the property of the applicant and only along those boundary or property lines which are shared by property in which an agricultural and forestal district is adjacent, or separated only by a body of water or a public or private road or highway.

8E-7-6 Covenants and easements:

Where covenants or easements are recorded which ensure that a buffer remain undisturbed, or where the buffer is enhanced by additional landscaping, fencing, or berming, the Advisory Committee shall take such enhancement into account and may reduce the required buffer accordingly.

## 8E-8. Disposition of buffers following withdrawal of property from or termination of an Agricultural and Forestal District.

8E-8-1 Buffers shall not outlast district:

Any buffer imposed upon a property as a result of its adjacency to an agricultural and forestal district shall cease to remain in effect after the agricultural and forestal district ceases to exist.
A required buffer shall become null and void only after the adjoining property in the agricultural and forestal district is withdrawn from such district or the district is terminated.
In order to make a buffer null and void, the owner of the property subject to the buffer must request that the zoning administrator verify that the conditions in this section have occurred.
If they have, and if there is a plat or record which reflects the buffer, the owner must record a plat which indicates the removal of the buffer.
Approval of such plat by the zoning administrator shall be required prior to recordation.

(Ord. of 11-4-2015(1))

## 8E-9. Creation of Districts/Additions to Districts.

8E-9-1 Requirements for creation of district:

Any owner or owners of land may submit an application to the Board of Supervisors for the creation of a district within Culpeper County.
Any application must be submitted no later than November 1st of each calendar year.
Each district shall have a core of no less than two hundred (200) acres in one (1) parcel or in contiguous parcels.
A parcel not part of the core may be included in such district if the nearest boundary of such parcel is within one (1) mile of the boundary of the core, or if it is contiguous to a parcel in the district the nearest boundary of which is within one (1) mile of the boundary of the core.
No land shall be included in any district without the signature on such application, or the written approval of all owners thereof.
(Ord. of 12-1-1998)

Editor's note(s)—Ord.
of 12-1-1998 added the November 1st deadline to this section.

Wherever in any zoning district, off-street facilities are provided for the parking or display of any and all types of vehicles, boats or heavy construction equipment, whether such vehicles, boats or pieces of equipment are self-propelled or not, such off-street facilities and all land upon which vehicles traverse the property as a function of the property use, including "drive-in" facilities, shall conform to the minimum requirements of these regulations.

(Ord. of 5-2-2006(2))

## 10-3. General Standards.

A.The parking and circulation system within each development shall accommodate the movement of vehicles, bicycles, pedestrians and, where appropriate, transit, throughout the proposed development and to and from surrounding areas, safely and conveniently, and shall contribute to the attractiveness of the development.
The on-site pedestrian system must provide adequate directness, continuity, street crossings, visible interest and security as defined by the standards of this Article.
The on-site bicycle system must connect to an adjacent bikeway network wherever it exists.

B.No building or use shall be permitted or constructed unless off-street parking spaces are provided in accordance with the provisions of this Article.

(Ord. of 5-2-2006(2))

## 10-4. Development Standards.

These development standards promote vehicle areas that are safe and attractive for motorists and pedestrians.
Vehicle use area locations are restricted in some zoning districts to promote the desired character of those zones.
These regulations are designed to provide pedestrian access that is protected from motor vehicle traffic, and create an environment that is inviting to pedestrians, bicycle and, where appropriate, transit users.
All development shall meet the following standards.

-   A.Safety Considerations. To the maximum extent feasible, pedestrians shall be separated from vehicles and bicycles. 1.Where complete separation of pedestrians, vehicles and bicycles is not possible, potential hazards shall be minimized by the use of techniques such as special paving, grade separations, pavement marking, signs or striping, bollards, median refuge areas, traffic calming features, landscaping, lighting or other means to clearly delineate pedestrian areas, for both day and night use.

2.Where pedestrians and bicyclists share walkways, the pedestrian/bicycle system shall be designed to be wide enough to easily accommodate the amount of pedestrian and bicycle traffic volumes that are anticipated.
A minimum width of eight (8) feet shall be required and shall meet American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) guidelines, Guide for Development of Bicycles Facilities, August 1991, or any successor publication.

-   B.Curbcuts and Ramps. Curbcuts and ramps shall be located at convenient, safe locations for the physically disabled, bicyclists, senior citizens and for people pushing strollers. The location and design of curbcuts and ramps shall meet the requirements of the Virginia Statewide Building Code, the Americans With Disabilities Act, and any applicable County standards. Curbcuts and ramps shall avoid crossing or funneling traffic through loading areas, drive-through lanes and outdoor trash storage/collection areas.
-   C.Site Amenities. Development plans that include off-street parking lots with more than one hundred (100) parking spaces, shall include site amenities that enhance safety and convenience and promote walking or bicycling as an alternative means of transportation. Site amenities should include such items as bike racks, canopies and benches.
-   D.Bicycle Facilities. All multi-family residential and governmental uses and all other non-residential uses requiring more than twenty parking spaces, shall provide bicycle facilities that meet the following standards: 1.Bicycle Parking. A minimum number of bicycle parking spaces shall be provided, equal to five (5) percent of the total number of automobile parking spaces provided by the development; however, no less than one (1) nor more than twenty (20) spaces shall be required for any one development.

2.Location.
For convenience and security, bicycle parking facilities shall be located near building entrances, shall be visible from the land uses they are designed to serve, and shall not be located in remote automobile parking areas.
Such facilities shall not, however, be located to impede pedestrian or automobile traffic flow nor to cause damage to landscape material from bicycle traffic.

3.Design.
Bicycle parking facilities shall be designed to allow the bicycle frame and one wheel to be securely locked to the parking structure.
The structure shall be of permanent construction such as heavy gauge tubular steel with angle bars permanently attached to the pavement.

-   E.Walkways. 1.Directness and Continuity. Walkways within the site shall be located and aligned to directly and continuously connect areas or points of pedestrian origin and destination, and shall not be located and aligned solely based on the outline of a parking lot configuration that does not provide such direct pedestrian access. Connecting walkways shall link building entrances with street sidewalks through parking lots. Connecting walkways shall be grade separated from the parking lot, with a paved surface not less than four (4) feet in width.

2.Street Crossings.
Where it is necessary for the primary pedestrian access to cross drive aisles or internal roadways, the pedestrian crossing shall emphasize and place priority on pedestrian access and safety.
The material and layout of the pedestrian access shall be continuous as it crosses the driveway, with a break in continuity of the driveway paving and not in the pedestrian access way.
The pedestrian crossings shall be well-marked using such techniques as pavement treatments, signs, painted striping, signals, lighting, traffic calming techniques, median refuge areas and landscaping.

3.Visibility, Safety and Security.
Connecting off-street walkways must be lighted in accordance with the standards found in Article 32.
Clear and direct lines of sight shall be provided in pedestrian settings to increase visibility, safety and security.

-   F.On-site Connectivity to Pedestrian and Bicycles Destinations. The on-site pedestrian and bicycle circulation system must be designed to provide, or allow for future, direct connections to major pedestrian and bicycle destinations including, but not limited to, parks, schools, government establishments, transit stops, and neighborhood commercial nodes that are located either within the development or adjacent to the development, to the maximum extent feasible. The on-site pedestrian and bicycle circulation system must also provide, or allow for future, on-site connections to existing or planned off-site pedestrian and bicycle facilities at points necessary to provide direct pedestrian and bicycle travel from the development to similar major pedestrian destinations located within the neighborhood. To provide such on-site direct pedestrian connections to these destinations, additional sidewalks or walkways not associated with a street, or the extension of a sidewalk from the end of a cul-de-sac to another street or walkway, may be required.
-   G.Drive-thru Stacking. Drive-thru banking facilities, drive-thru restaurants, drive-thru pharmacies, and similar uses shall require adequate stacking space for four (4) vehicles for each customer window.
-   H.Paving. Unless otherwise exempted under the provisions of this Ordinance, all public access off-street parking areas including aisles and entrances shall be paved with a durable dust-free hard surface. The Zoning Administrator or Planning Commission may allow permeable surfaces if approved as part of an overall Low-Impact Development (LID) design for the parking lot for the purposes of stormwater management. Curb and gutter shall be installed where deemed necessary by the Zoning Administrator or Planning Commission within off-street parking areas in order to manage storm drainage, channelize traffic, protect buildings and landscaping areas, and separate pedestrian and vehicular circulation areas. The requirements of this subsection shall not apply to off-street parking areas serving single-family detached or duplex dwellings. The Zoning Administrator or Planning Commission may approve a temporary or permanent modification or waiver to this subsection so as to allow for gravel and other parking surfaces in instances where it is deemed to be appropriate based upon the scope, nature, or location of the proposed development or use. (Ords. of 5-2-2006(2); 9-3-2013)

## 10-5. Access and Off-Street Parking Requirements.

All vehicular use areas in any proposed development shall be designed to be safe, efficient, convenient and attractive.
In addition, all vehicular use areas shall be designed considering all modes of transportation that may use the system, including without limitation, cars, trucks, buses, bicycles and emergency vehicles.

-   A.Access. Unobstructed vehicular access to and from a public street shall be provided for all off-street parking spaces. Vehicular access shall be provided in such manner as to protect the safety of persons using such access or traveling in the public street from which such access is obtained and in such manner as to not reduce the traffic-carrying capacity of the public street from which such access is obtained. All off-street parking areas of five (5) or more spaces shall be designed so no parking or maneuvering shall be on any public street, right-of-way, or sidewalk, and, except as otherwise allowed herein, so all vehicles, except as allowed in Section 10-4(G), can be parked and unparked without moving another vehicle. In addition, off-street parking spaces shall be arranged so no vehicle shall be required to back out directly onto a public street.
-   B.Location. 1.All off-street parking spaces, whether required or excess, shall be located on the same lot as the building or use for which they are required unless:

a.Such spaces are provided collectively by two (2) or more buildings or uses on abutting lots in a single parking area located within the boundaries of such abutting lots, and the total number of parking spaces supplied collectively is equal to the number of spaces required by this Article for each use considered separately, or

b.For non-residential uses, an off-site parking agreement must be approved by the Planning Commission.
In such instances, the off-site parking facilities shall be located within three hundred (300) feet of the building they are intended to serve.
The application for an off-site parking agreement shall demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Planning Commission that practical difficulties prevent the location of all the off-street parking on site.

1.Off-site parking agreements, in a form acceptable to the County Attorney, shall provide: that the land comprising the parking facilities shall not be disposed of except in conjunction with the sale of the premises which the parking area serves, so long as the facilities are required; that the owner(s) agrees to bear the expense of recording the agreement; agrees that the agreement shall bind their heirs, successors and assigns and demonstrates that a safe pedestrian route exists.

2.Parking of any vehicles in the front yard of a lot on which exists a single-family detached or duplex dwelling, except such dwellings associated with agricultural uses, shall be prohibited unless such vehicles are parked on an improved area having a surface of asphalt, concrete, rock, shell, gravel or similar inorganic material.

3.Guest Parking.
Off-street guest parking spaces in multi-family developments shall be distributed proportionally to the dwelling unit locations they are intended to serve.
Generally, such parking shall not be located more than two hundred (200) feet from the dwelling units intended to be served.

4.In residential zone districts, only off-street parking areas to serve the uses allowed in such residential zone districts shall be permitted in such district.

5.A use located in a non-residential zoning district shall not gain its access through, nor have its off-street parking area located in, a residential zoning district.

-   C.Lighting. All off-street parking and vehicular use areas of twenty (20) or more spaces shall be lighted in accordance with Article 32.
-   D.Maintenance. The property owner shall be responsible for maintaining all off-street parking and vehicular use areas in good condition and free of refuse and debris and all landscaping in a healthy and growing condition.
-   E.Use. Off-street parking and vehicular use areas shall not be used for sales, outdoor storage, repair, dismantling or servicing of any type or kind, nor shall areas devoted to such activities count towards meeting a use's off-street parking requirement. (Ord. of 5-2-2006(2))

## 10-6. Parking Lot Layout.

For the purposes of this section, the term "parking lot" shall mean an off-street parking area of fifteen (15) or more vehicles.
These parking lot layout standards are intended to promote safe circulation within parking areas and to provide for convenient ingress and egress of motor vehicles.

-   A.Circulation Routes. Parking lots shall provide well-defined circulation routes for vehicles, bicycles and pedestrians.
-   B.Traffic Control Devices. Standard traffic control signs and devices shall be used to direct traffic where necessary within a parking lot.
-   C.Landscaping. All parking lots shall be landscaped in accordance with Article XXX of this Ordinance.
-   D.Points of Pedestrian Conflict. The layout and design of parking lots shall specifically address the interrelation of pedestrians, vehicular and bicycle circulation to provide continuous, direct pedestrian access with a minimum of driveway and drive aisle crossings. Remedial treatment such as raised pedestrian crossings, forecourts and landings, special paving, signs, lights and bollards shall be provided at significant points of conflict. Large parking lots shall include internal walkways that are located in places that are logical and convenient for pedestrians.
-   E.User Needs. Layout and design shall anticipate the needs of users and provide continuity between vehicular circulation, parking, pedestrians and bicycle circulation. Pedestrian drop-off areas shall be provided where needed, especially for land uses that serve children and the elderly.
-   F.Curbs and Stops. All paved off-street parking lots shall use curbs, vehicle stops or other similar devices to prevent vehicles from overhanging on or into, public rights-of-way, landscaped areas, or abutting lots.
-   G.Truck Traffic. All uses that are located adjacent to or within two hundred (200) feet of residentially zoned property and that generate truck traffic shall avoid or mitigate impacts through physical design measures such as berming, landscaping, and fencing.
-   H.Setbacks. All paved off-street parking and vehicle use areas, except for ingress/egress drives, shall be set back from lot lines (except a lot line between buildings or uses in unified developments) in accordance with the following table:

Table 10-1

| Street Classifications | Minimum width of setback at any point |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Along arterial streets | 20 ft.                                |
| Along all other streets| 10 ft.                                |
| Along a lot line       | 5 ft.                                 |
| Along alleys           | 0 ft.                                 |

(Ord. of 5-2-2006(2))

## 10-7. Required Number of Off-Street Parking Spaces by Use.

The following parking requirements are established for all zoning districts.

-   A.[Minimum off-street parking spaces.] The minimum number of off-street parking spaces for use categories is stated in Table 10-2. Table 10-2 applies unless specifically superseded or modified by other portions of this Ordinance or the County Code, or in connection with the approval of a site plan where the Planning Commission specifically grants a modification.
-   B.Computation of Required Spaces. Fractional space requirements shall be rounded up to the next whole number. In stadiums, sports arenas, churches/synagogues, and other places of public assembly where occupants utilize benches, pews or similar fixed seating arrangements, each eighteen (18) lineal inches of such seating shall be counted as one seat.
-   C.Uses Not Listed. The Zoning Administrator shall determine the parking requirements for uses not listed herein based on the requirements for similar uses and the traffic characteristics of the use.
-   D.Handicapped Parking. Handicapped parking shall be provided consistent with the requirements of Virginia Uniform Statewide Building Code, as may be amended.
-   E.Shared Parking. When a mix of uses creates staggered peak periods of parking demand, shared parking may be used to reduce the total amount of required parking, if approved by the Planning Commission in conjunction with site plan approval. In such instances, the applicants shall demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Planning Commission that the periods of peak use are separated sufficiently and shared parking spaces are available to all uses showing them, so as to not cause a parking demand problem.
-   F.Separate Calculations. When a use has more than twenty percent (20%) of its floor area in a distinct function (i.e., office, meeting facility, warehouse, retail), the amount of required parking shall be calculated separately for each function. An example would be a 40,000 sq. ft. use with a 10,000 sq. ft. office area and a 30,000 sq. ft. warehouse. In this example, the required parking would be computed separately for the office and warehouse functions.

Where district boundaries are indicated as approximately following or being at right angles to the center lines of streets, highways, alleys, railroad main tracks, such center line, or lines at right angles to such center lines, shall be construed to be such boundaries as the case may be.

14-1-2 Boundaries following bodies of water:

Where a district boundary is indicated to follow a river, creek, or branch or other body of water, said boundary shall be construed to follow the center line at low water or at the limit of the jurisdiction, and in the event of change in the shoreline, such boundary shall be construed as moving with the actual shoreline.

14-1-3 Other boundary determinants:

If no distance, angle, curvature description of other means is given to determine a boundary line accurately and the foregoing provisions do not apply, the same shall be determined by the zoning administrator by using the scale shown on said zoning map.

2.Notice to repair.
If the county finds and declares that a SBF has fallen into disrepair, become unsafe or a danger to the public health safety and general welfare, the zoning administrator may issue a written notice to the owner of the wireless communication facility or the property on which it is located, or both, demanding that the nuisance be abated within thirty (30) days or such period of time as the county building official may determine is reasonable.

3.The county is not responsible for maintenance of a SBF.

4.The applicant shall obtain all required zoning and/or building permits for the SBF; including submitting any necessary documentation to ensure structural integrity.

5.SBF(s)shall not be lighted.

# ARTICLE 21. TRUNK THOROUGHFARE SETBACKS AND FUTURE STREET LINES

## 21-1. Finding of necessity.

In order that the Comprehensive Land Use Plan embodied in this Article shall be property related to a comprehensive plan of thoroughfares for the County, and to assure that the continuing intensification of land use in the foreseeable future will not result in the erection of buildings in locations which will unduly restrict vehicular traffic capacity, it is hereby determined that building setbacks greater than those set forth in the regulations for the respective districts established by this Ordinance are required for buildings adjacent to certain thoroughfares within the County.
It is further determined that, in furtherance of this foregoing policy, future street lines may also be required.

Both the building setback lines and future lines referred to in section 21-1 may be specified by the County by the governing body from time to time and shall be shown on a map adopted by the governing body which may also amend any such map from time to time.
Before taking any of the foregoing action, the governing body shall refer the proposed map or proposed amendment thereto to the Planning Commission for its recommendations thereon, and shall hold a public hearing on the proposal in accordance with the same procedure as that specified by law in connection with amendments of this Ordinance.
Any such map adopted under the provisions of this Article shall be recorded in the office of the Clerk of the Circuit Court.

## 21-3. Future street lines to be used in application of regulations.

After the designation of future street lines for any streets as specified in the preceding section, all distances specified in any of the regulations contained in this Ordinance with reference to street lines shall be measured from the future street lines for such street.
If any future street lines designated as aforesaid are located other than in relation to an existing street, such lines shall be deemed to be street lines for the purpose of the application of the provisions of this Ordinance.

# ARTICLE 29. CONDITIONAL ZONING

## 29-1. Policy and purpose.

It is the general policy of Culpeper County, in accordance with the provisions of § 15.2-2283, Code of Virginia, to provide for the orderly development of land, for all purposes, through zoning and other land development legislation.
Frequently, where competing and incompatible uses conflict, traditional zoning methods and procedures are inadequate.
In these cases, more flexible and adaptable zoning methods are needed to permit differing land uses and at the same time to recognize effects of change.
It is the purpose of this Article to provide a more flexible and adaptable zoning method to cope with situations found in such zones through conditional zoning, whereby a zoning reclassification may be allowed subject to certain conditions proffered by the zoning applicant for the protection of the community's interests that are not generally applicable to land similarly zoned.
(Ords. of 2-5-1980; 7-3-1990)

Any owner of real property who is an applicant for a Zoning Map amendment (rezoning) of his property may, as part of his application, proffer, in writing, reasonable conditions concerning the use and development of his property, including off-site improvements that may serve or benefit his property and the public welfare.

29-2-1 Rezoning creates need:

The rezoning itself gives rise to the need for the proffered conditions:

Such conditions have a reasonable relation to the rezoning; and

All such conditions are in conformity with the Comprehensive Plan of Culpeper County.

Original statements or materials first submitted after the Planning Commission hearing are subject to re-referral to the commission for comment before the opening of the Supervisors' hearing.
Substantial amendments submitted later than two (2) weeks prior to the final public hearing of the Board of Supervisors shall not be deemed acceptable for incorporation into the statement or materials but shall be accepted for consideration of the need for a further public hearing by the Board of Supervisors, which may schedule an additional public hearing to consider late amendments, at its option.

29-4-2 Late submission of amendments:

Any late amendment submission shall act to extend by a period of one month the total time allowed by law for review and consideration of a rezoning request if, by virtue of the above requirement for an additional public hearing and the Board's schedule, the matter would be placed for hearing after the expiration of the allowed review period.

In some instances as identified herein, the Zoning Administrator may issue certificates of appropriateness.
