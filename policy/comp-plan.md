Relevant excerpts for residential subdivision policy analysis

# CH 2. LAND USE & DEVELOPMENT

Preserve the predominantly agricultural & rural nature of Culpeper County while providing opportunities for growth in identified areas at the appropriate scale.

## Goal 1: Maintain a balanced growth approach that shifts development pressure away from the outlying agricultural & rural areas and direct it to the Urban Services Boundary and the iden tified Future Growth Areas

### Pathway 1: Ensure that agricultural, forestal, and other important rural lands are protected from growth pressure and that new uses are compatible with these areas.

#### Action Item: Maintain the Agricultural Zoning District in the County Zoning Ordinance & in the Future Land Use Plan to keep use densities and intensities to a minimum, so as to limit urban sprawl into the countryside.

#### Action Item: Revise portions of the Zoning and Subdivision Ordinances, such as acreage requirements and minor subdivision rules, to limit the amount and impact of development in areas outside of identified growth areas, specifically on land zoned as Agricultural (A1) and Rural Area (RA).

### Pathway 2: Steer general community growth towards the Urban Services Boundary and the identified Future Growth Areas to efficiently utilize existing infrastructure and to preserve largely undeveloped rural areas.

#### Action Item: Revise portions of the Zoning and Subdivision Ordinances, such as minimum lot sizes, allowed uses, and specifically the Planned Unit Development (PUD) District’s acreage minimum, to encourage and incentivize dense, mixed-use development in the aforementioned areas.

### Pathway 3: Ensure that existing and new developments positively contribute to quality-of-life factors.

#### Action Item: Protect features such as floodplains, steep slopes, streams and rivers, viewsheds, etc., through measures such as buffering, tree preservation, and environmental impact analysis.

#### Action Item: Ensure financial impacts for service expansion associated with developments are mitigated whenever possible.

### Pathway 4: Revise and rewrite the zoning district regulations in the Zoning Ordinance.

#### Action Item: Revise definitions so that they are more conducive to facilitating Goal 1, such as zoning districts associated with growth areas encouraging more diverse and dense development, and agricultural districts maintaining the rural character.

## Goal 4: Support a diverse housing mix with a range of sizes and types that meet the needs of citizens throughout all stages of life and at all income levels, especially within identified growth areas.

### Pathway 1: Explore potential Zoning Ordinance changes regarding the types of housing allowed in various higher density residential zoning districts.

#### Action Item: Revise policies and ordinances to allow or encourage smaller lot sizes and alternative housing types, especially within the Urban Services Boundary and other identified growth areas, so as to steer as much growth as possible from Culpeper County’s rural areas and to increase the amount of attainable housing.

#### Action Item: Consider alterations to the additional dwelling unit regulations.

### Pathway 4: Maintain existing affordable/attainable housing stock.

# CH 5. ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT

## Goal 1: Continue to expand the economic base of Culpeper County in a manner that complements existing businesses and the County character.

### Pathway 2: Ensure future economic development is compatible with the existing land use fabric.

## Goal 2: Continue to provide support for the agricultural industry to sustain its viability as a business.

### Pathway 1: Enhance and expand upon existing public support for the agricultural sector.

#### Action Item: Maintain existing policies that are supportive of agricultural business, such as the land use taxation scheme and the agricultural/forestal districts program.
