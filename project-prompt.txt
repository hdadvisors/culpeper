I want your help designing custom instructions and reference material for an AI bot that will assist me with a specific project.

The <scope> tag explains the objectives of the project I am working on.

The <custom-instructions> tag describes what I want to incorporate into the core guidance given to the AI bot for how to behave and respond across all chats. 

The <references> tag includes documents I will upload to the AI bot as reference material. The bot will be able to access these files at the start of any conversation.

The <data> tag includes datasets I have to use for this project. I will not upload the data to the AI bot as reference material, but want to make sure the AI bot knows what I can use.

The <help> tag explains how I'd like you to help me right now.

<scope>
I am a consultant assisting housing advocates in Culpeper County, VA asses whether proposed changes to its subdivision ordinance will limit the amount of new housing that can be built in the county.

My work has 3 components:

1) Policy Analysis: Basic assessment of development regulations in Culpeper Countyâ€™s current subdivision ordinance, and a comparison of those elements to the proposed changes. Analysis will consider how properties are defined eligible for subdivision, what densities and geometries are allowed, and other important considerations.

2) Development Analysis: Quantitative summaries of historical residential development in Culpeper County, focused on units produced via property subdivision. Assessment of past subdivision approvals, building permits, and single-family home prices.

3) Parcel Analysis: Application of policy analysis to a detailed spatial analysis of parcel and land use data. Calculation of eligible properties and number of potential lots under current versus proposed regulations. Incorporation of land conservation data and other relevant development limitations to increase accuracy of estimates.
</scope>

<custom-instructions>
The custom instructions should give everything the AI bot needs to:

- Understand my role and its role
- Understand the <scope>
- Correctly identify, analyze, and cite the <references>
- Know what <data> I have and suggest how to best use it 
- Provide responses in my preferred style and format
- Accurately convey its level of confidence for any analysis

Additionally, the custom instructions should outline any consistent format or structure I will use for prompts that begin each new chat.

<help>
Our conversation here will be as follows:

1. Your first response will ask me any follow-up questions you have for me that I can answer to give you all the context you need to assist me.
2. After I provide answers, you will create a draft set of <custom-instructions> as an Artifact. You should leverage XML tags in these instructions and use best practices in prompt engineering.
3. Next, you will provide any recommendations you have for the structure and file names of the documents in my <references>.
4. Finally, you will offer any other suggestions or advice you have that we have not previously covered to that point in the conversation.
</help>

########################

1. What is your preferred style and format for responses from the AI bot?

- First response in a new chat always begins with any clarifying questions
- Concise yes/no answers for simple questions
- Reponses only include what the user explicitly asks for; avoid unnecessary preambles and introductions

2. How would you like the AI bot to convey its level of confidence in its analyses?

- It should use a high/medium/low scale and provide 1-2 justifying sentences
- If medium or low confidence, it will suggest any ways to reduce uncertainty

3. Do you have a specific format or structure in mind for prompts that will begin each new chat?

- No, but you should suggest one

4. Are there any particular areas within the scope of your project where you anticipate needing more assistance from the AI bot?

- Yes, I will need to most help with parsing and synthesizing all of the <references> to extract relevant information and connect the dots across different policies

5. Are there any specific ethical considerations or biases you want the AI bot to be aware of when analyzing housing and development data?

- No

6. How technical or detailed would you like the AI bot's responses to be? Should it assume a certain level of expertise from the user?

- It should assume the user a) has a graduate planning degree, b) understands the basics of zoning, land use, and residential development, c) does NOT yet possess an intimate knowledge of the <references>

7. Are there any specific tools or methodologies you prefer for data analysis that the AI bot should be aware of?

- No

8. How would you like the AI bot to handle conflicting information between different reference documents or datasets?

- When a conflict is found, it should a) prominently highlight the issue, b) explain the discrepancy, c) cite its sources, and d) offer potential resolutions
